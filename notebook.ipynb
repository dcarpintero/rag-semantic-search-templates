Introduction \\nSubsistence agriculture is the main livelihood for millions of \\nhouseholds in Africa and South Asia, where smallholder farms ( < 2 ha) \\naccount for over 30% of the food produced ( Herrero et al., 2017 ). \\nHowever, yields in Africa and South Asia are still below potential levels \\n( Godfray and Garnett, 2014 ), so the vast majority of smallholder \\ncommunities continue to experience poverty and food insecurity. The \\nsituation is worsened by climate change, which has put smallholder \\ncommunities at risk and reinforced poverty and vulnerability ( Knox \\net al., 2012 ). One way to spur economic growth and help populations in \\nAfrica and South Asia escape poverty is by transforming agriculture \\n( AGRA, 2017; Gassner et al., 2019 ), e.g., through intensification. How -\\never, it is important that this intensification involves crops and cropping \\n* Corresponding author at: Department of Botany, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), P.O.

Cover crops sown on 9 – 10 August had the lowest \\nnitrate concentration in the drainage water over autumn and winter \\nmonths (mid-September to February) compared with the later sowing \\ntimes in all the drainage periods ( Figs. 3, 4, 5 ). There were very slight \\ndifferences in nitrate concentrations during the first measurements in \\nthe drainage periods among most of the sowing times, with exceptions \\nfor oats in 2019 – 20 and 2021 – 2022. Nitrate concentrations from the \\nbare soil were higher than soil with cover crops in autumn. There was a \\nslight increase in nitrate concentration in the later phase of spring, \\nparticularly with phacelia and oats. Fodder radish plots showed a \\npattern of increasing nitrate concentration with subsequent sowings in \\nall the drainage periods. However, the same clear pattern was not found \\nwith phacelia and oats. \\n3.4. Nitrate leaching reduction \\nNitrate leaching reduction significantly decreased with delayed \\nsowing ( Table 3 ). Overall, the reduction decreased from the highest at \\nfirst sowing to the lowest at the last sowing with an average per day \\ndecrease of 0.8 kg N ha\\n-1 \\nin the species ( Fig. 6 ). The nitrate leaching \\nreduction was significantly affected by cover crop species and drainage \\nperiod. However, the effect was the same between the cover crops as \\nwell as drainage periods (same slope of \\x00 0.8; Table 3 , Figs. 6 a, 6 b). With \\na significantly higher intercept fodder radish on average reduced nitrate \\nleaching more than phacelia and oats ( Fig. 6 a). The respective values \\nwere 64 kg N ha\\n-1\\n, 47 kg N ha\\n-1\\n, and 44 kg N ha\\n-1\\n) (post-hoc pairwise \\ncomparisons, Supplementary Table S2 ). Similarly, the average reduction \\nin the three cover crops differed between years and was significantly \\nhigher for the drainage periods 2021 – 22 (63 kg N ha\\n-1\\n) than 2019 – 20 \\n(46 kg N ha\\n-1\\n) and 2020 – 21 (46 kg N ha\\n-1\\n) ( Supplementary Table S2 ). \\nThe variations among the plots appeared to be more pronounced in the \\ndrainage period 2019 – 20 than 2020 – 21 and 2021 – 22 in the measured \\ndata at different sowing times ( Fig. 6 ). The blocks accounted for a \\nconsiderable amount of variation (sample of variance = s\\n2 \\n= 345.3), \\nwhich resulted in large variation around the estimated slope ( Fig. 6 ). \\nHowever, the patterns with the sowing times were largely consistent \\nwithin blocks, and the variation was accounted for in the models as \\nblock was included as a random effect. \\nFig. 3.

As \\nthe N uptake was analyzed in a logarithmic model, this means that \\nleaching reduced with increasing N uptake at higher rates when N up -\\ntake was smaller, and the effect became less steep with high N uptake \\nlevels ( Fig. 7 ). The logarithmic function with a slope coefficient of \\x00 20.6 \\nx log of N uptake showed that overall a 1% increase in N uptake reduced \\nnitrate leaching by 0.09 kg N ha\\n-1\\n. This effect was neither dependent on \\ncover crop species nor on drainage periods (no significant interactions), \\nbut different intercepts ( Table 3 ) that lead to overall differences in ni -\\ntrate leaching. On average the leaching was significantly lower for \\nfodder radish than for phacelia and oats (post-hoc pairwise comparisons, \\nSupplementary Table S3 ). The average leaching for individual drainage \\nperiods were also significantly different from each other, with drainage \\nperiod 2019 – 20 having significantly more leaching than the other two \\nperiods. \\n4. Discussion \\n4.1. Nitrogen uptake response to sowing time \\nN uptake in cover crops decreased with delayed sowing time, and the \\ndecrease was different between different cover crop species, and be -\\ntween different years ( Fig. 2 ). This indicates that the cover crops had \\ndifferent abilities to take up N from the soil and translocate that to \\nabove-ground organs, which were stimulated by the sowing time and \\ngrowing conditions in the year. Although the N uptake in phacelia and \\noats was higher than in fodder radish at first sowing, the decrease in N \\nuptake with the later sowing times was less pronounced for fodder \\nradish than the other two crops. This suggests that fodder radish is better \\nadapted to the deteriorating growing conditions in autumn than pha -\\ncelia and oats. The average N uptake in the cover crops was 33 kg N ha\\n-1 \\nfrom the sowing on 9 – 10th August, which is in the range of N uptake in \\nthe cover crops sown on the recommended dates in Denmark, Sweden, \\nNorway, and Finland ( Thomsen and Hansen, 2014; Aronsson et al., \\n2016 ). At the sowing time on 7 September, N uptake in cover crops \\nFig. 4.
